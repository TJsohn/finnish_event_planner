          memorable story. Our platform, which was inspired by the renowned
          Viking woman Freyd√≠s Eir√≠ksd√≥ttir, is a symbol of bravery,
          self-reliance, and the unwavering quest for life-changing events. Our
          goal is to enable everyone to take center stage this summer, whether
          as makers, guests, or storytellers, much like the Norse warrior queen
          who bravely fought her way across new waters. The Spirit of Freydis
          Freydis's name comes from Old Norse and meaning "goddess" or "noble
          woman of the gods." Freyd√≠s Eir√≠ksd√≥ttir, the daughter of famed
          explorer Erik the Red, was well known for her great bravery and
          unyielding tenacity. We own this energy! The Freydis is a movement it
          is more than just a platform. Honoring people who have the courage to
          create, connect, and experience something greater. Like the Norse
          explorers who left their mark on history, you can leave your mark on
          summertime with a memorable event.
