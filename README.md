- Work as a team efficiently: everyone can bring up their opinions and solutions equally and the whole team can decide which will be the best approach for the application
- Experience a real-world working environment with daily meetings and remote working
- Have better time management with precise task deadlines

### What we'd improve

- Initialize the project in a more decisive way: decide what technology is the most approachable and suitable for the team based on skills and abilities

- Avoid misunderstandings among the team members by being active in team's conversations, bring out any issues we have faced and ask for support if needed
